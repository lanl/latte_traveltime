# Description
**LATTE: Los Alamos TravelTime package based on Eikonal equation**

This is an open-source software for traveltime computation based on the eikonal equation, adjoint-state first-arrival traveltime tomography, and source location in 2D/3D isotropic acoustic/elastic media. 

The work is supported by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) Laboratory Directory Research and Development (LDRD) project 20240322ER. LANL is operated by Triad National Security, LLC, for the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under Contract No. 89233218CNA000001. The research uses high-performance computing resources provided by LANL's Institutional Computing (IC) program. 

The work is under LANL open source approval reference O4770.

# Requirement
`LATTE` depends on [FLIT](https://github.com/lanl/flit). Some examples in [example](example) use [RGM](https://github.com/lanl/rgm) to generate random geological models. 

The code is written in Fortran + MPI. Currently, it can only be compiled with Intel's compiler suite [Intel oneAPI HPC Toolkit](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/hpc-toolkit.html).

# Use
To install `LATTE`, 

```
cd src
ruby install.rb
```

The compiled `LATTE` executables will be at `bin`.

To remake, 

```
cd src
ruby install.rb clean
```

We include several simple examples to use `LATTE` in [example](example). To run the tests, 

```
cd test
```

and the scripts to reproduce the examples in the mansucript are contained in subfolders.
