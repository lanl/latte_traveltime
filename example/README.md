* The plotting scripts in some of the examples need the three Python scripts in [python](https://github.com/lanl/latte_traveltime/tree/main/misc/python). You need to make links to these files in the subfolders.
* You need the [FLIT](https://github.com/lanl/flit) package to create the models and source-receiver geometry files with the Fortran codes in the subdirectories. You can also use your own tools to generate these files. 
* You need the [RGM](https://github.com/lanl/rgm) package to generate the random geological models used in the examples. 
* You need the [pymplot](https://github.com/lanl/pymplot) package to plot results with the Ruby scripts in the subdirectories.
